# Whale: Cut Onboarding Time by 50%, Train Teams Faster, Document Processes in Minutes

So you've got processes scattered everywhere—Google Docs, someone's brain, sticky notes from 2019. Your new hires take forever to get up to speed, and every time you ask "how do we do this?" you get five different answers. Sound familiar?

That's where Whale comes in. It's an AI-powered platform that turns your messy procedures into actual documentation people can use. And when I say "actual documentation," I don't mean another folder everyone ignores—I mean interactive guides, automated training, and answers that show up right when people need them.

## What Makes Whale Different (Besides the Name)

Here's the thing: Whale isn't trying to be another knowledge base where information goes to die. The platform focuses on three things that actually matter—documenting your processes fast, training your team automatically, and making sure people can find answers without bugging you every five minutes.

The AI does the heavy lifting. You can record your screen while working, and Whale turns it into step-by-step instructions with screenshots. Got a video? Upload it, and the AI transcribes it into a written procedure. Already have docs? Import them, and they convert automatically. One company, Cash-Wa Direct, cut their onboarding time in half using this approach.

Then there's Alice—that's their AI assistant. She learns your company's procedures and answers questions in real-time. Someone needs to know how to process a refund at 2 AM? Alice has it covered. No digging through folders, no waiting for responses. Just instant answers based on your actual SOPs.

## How the Platform Actually Works

The documentation tools are pretty straightforward. Step Recorder captures your clicks and keystrokes automatically, generating visual guides as you work. Screen Recorder lets you narrate complex processes. There's also an AI Writer that drafts procedures in seconds—you just review and tweak.

For training, you can create custom flows for different roles. New sales rep? They get the sales playbook. Customer service hire? Different path entirely. The system tracks who's completing what, generates quizzes automatically, and sends reminders when assignments are due. Aurora Medical Spa used this to give 85+ employees instant access to procedures across multiple locations.

Access happens everywhere. Browser extensions for Chrome and Edge. Mobile apps for iOS and Android. QR codes you can stick on equipment. Slack integration for quick questions. The AI assistant works across all of them, so your warehouse workers get the same instant answers as your office team.

## Pricing That Actually Makes Sense

Let's talk numbers. Whale has four tiers, and unlike most SaaS companies, they're pretty transparent about what you get:

| Plan | Monthly Price | Yearly Price | Users Included | Key Features |
|------|--------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Free** | $0 | $0 | 5 | Unlimited docs, step recorder, screen recorder, video-to-SOP converter, checklists |
| **Team** | $149 | $99/month | 10 (+$15/mo or $10/mo yearly per extra user) | Everything in Free + PDF/Word export, permissions, expert reviews, custom branding, version history |
| **Scale** | $449 | $299/month | 25 (+$18/mo or $12/mo yearly per extra user) | Everything in Team + training flows, AI quizzes, user roles, badges, org chart |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Starting at $1,200/month | Custom | Everything in Scale + SCIM, HRIS integration, API access, unlimited workspaces, migration services |

The yearly plans save you 33% right off the bat. Non-profits get an additional 20% discount on all plans. And if you're just testing things out, the free plan is actually useful—not a neutered demo version.

There's also a special 60% discount available for the first 3 months on annual billing plans. 👉 [**Explore Whale's pricing options and start your free trial**](https://usewhale.io)

## AI Tokens: The Fine Print

Each plan comes with AI tokens for features like quiz generation and video-to-guide conversion. Team gets 25/month, Scale gets 75/month, Enterprise gets 500/month. The good news? Alice (the AI assistant) doesn't use tokens—she's unlimited. Tokens reset monthly, and if you run out, you can request more or upgrade.

## Who's Actually Using This

The platform works for companies running on EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System) who need to document their way of working. Oxygen Service Company used it to centralize and update their growing processes. Manufacturing teams use it for warehouse floor procedures. IT companies for client documentation. Real estate agencies for transaction protocols.

According to reviews on G2 and Capterra, users consistently mention three things: the interface is dead simple, customer support responds fast, and the AI features actually save time. The platform has a 4.8/5 rating on G2 for ease of use.

## The Features That People Actually Care About

**Documentation**: Over 100 templates for different industries. Google Drive and OneDrive integration so you can import existing docs. Image editor for annotations. GIF and stock library for visual guides.

**Sharing**: Contextual suggestions through browser extensions—Whale proactively shows relevant procedures while people work. QR codes for physical spaces. Public sharing for client-facing documentation.

**Training**: Automated assignment flows. Progress tracking dashboards. Checklists for consistent execution. Org charts showing who's excelling at what.

**Management**: Version history to track changes. Expert review cycles to keep content current. Analytics showing what's working and what isn't. Role-based permissions at board and library levels.

**Integrations**: Slack, Microsoft Teams, Asana, ClickUp, monday.com, Smartsheet, HubSpot, Salesforce, Zoho. Plus Zapier for connecting 1,000+ apps.

## The Real Benefits (According to Actual Users)

Companies report cutting documentation time by 70-84% with the AI tools. The screen recorder alone eliminates hours of manual screenshot-and-annotation work. One review mentioned rolling out Whale fast enough to use it as a training lifesaver while their admin was on maternity leave.

The training automation means new hires complete most onboarding independently, saving manager time for focused work instead of repetitive explanations. Image Solutions, a uniform service provider, streamlined their internal processes for 100+ team members using Whale's organized approach.

For remote and field workers, the mobile access is huge. Warehouse teams, construction crews, service technicians—they all get instant procedure access without heading back to an office computer.

## Migration and Support

Whale offers full migration services on higher plans. Their team will move your existing documents, set up your workspace structure, and train your team. There are also Whale Certified Consultants if you want hands-on help implementing.

Customer support gets mentioned a lot in reviews—quick responses, helpful guidance, and actual solutions instead of canned answers. They do live training sessions, maintain a knowledge base, and offer Teams/Slack channels for Enterprise customers.

## Should You Actually Use This?

If you're between 50-500 employees and currently storing procedures in Google Docs, shared drives, or people's heads, Whale makes sense. If onboarding takes forever because nobody documented how things actually work, it makes sense. If you're scaling and need consistency across locations or teams, it makes sense.

It doesn't make sense if you're a solo operator or a huge enterprise with custom requirements (though they do have an Enterprise plan for that). And if you're already happy with your current system and everyone can find what they need instantly, maybe stick with it.

The free plan lets you test with 5 users and unlimited documentation. That's enough to see if the approach works for your team without committing money. 👉 [**Start documenting your processes for free with Whale**](https://usewhale.io)

## Getting Started

Sign up takes about 30 seconds. You can import existing docs immediately or start fresh with templates. The AI tools are available from day one—even on the free plan. Most teams are creating their first procedures within an hour of signing up.

For growing teams tired of messy documentation and slow onboarding, Whale offers a practical solution. The AI handles the grunt work, the training automates itself, and your team gets answers when they need them. Simple as that.
